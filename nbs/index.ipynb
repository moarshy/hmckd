    "For this task, you are given a set of longitudinal data (attached) of different lab measurements for patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Furthermore, you are also given the information whether these patients progress in their CKD stage or not in the future. Using this dataset, you are required to come up with a solution to predict whether a patient will progress in CKD staging given the patient's past longitudinal information.\n",
